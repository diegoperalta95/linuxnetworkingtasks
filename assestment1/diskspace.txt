The df -h command gives us some information about the space of the system and how it is being used.

The filesystem column indicates the type of filesystem used.
The Size, Used, Avail and Use% shows us the status, how much capacity we have occuped of available for user.
The "mounted on" column show us the route of where is it accesible for us to navigate.

The -h flag makes all numerical sizes easily readable for humans, e.g instead of showing "2428" it says "2.4M"
